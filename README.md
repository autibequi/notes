# Personal Public Notes Respository

This is a simple repository so that I can save/share some knowledge that is not so big to have it’s own repository and it’s neither so small that can be saved on a GIST.

Another reason is the ease of sharing.

I could use Google Docs but I just enjoy taking notes with markdown.

Most notes were made using [Typora](https://typora.io/).

Feel free to submit any fixes to any text in this repository to contribute for a `error free` internet.
