# Personal Public Notes Respository

This is a simple repository so that I can save/share some knowledge that is not so big to have it’s own repository and it’s neither so small that can be saved on a GIST.

Another reason is the ease of sharing.

I could use Google docs but I just enjoy taking notes with markdown.

Most notes were made using Typora.
