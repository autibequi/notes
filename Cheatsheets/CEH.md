## About

All commands here were executed on in the oficial `Kali Linux` docker image. 

To create a container and `ssh` over it, execute the following command:

> docker run -ti kalilinux/kali-linux-docker /bin/bash

The image comes barebones and you may need to install other applications. Bellow there is a list of metapackages that can be installed.
