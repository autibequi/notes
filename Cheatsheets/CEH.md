# CEH Cheatsheet

A mental dump while watching CEH courses and tuts.

[TOC]

## About

The notes in this file are based (but not limited) on  [The Complete Ethical Hacking Course](https://www.udemy.com/penetration-testing/).

## Environment

All commands here were executed on in the oficial `Kali Linux` docker image (because Iâ€™m too lazy to setup a full VM).

To create a container and `ssh` over it, execute the following command:

> docker run -ti kalilinux/kali-linux-docker /bin/bash

The image comes barebones and you may need to install other applications. There is a list of [metapackages](https://www.kali.org/news/kali-linux-metapackages) that can be installed with bundle of softwares required to use these notes.

## Verbatum

* FUD - Fully Undetectable - ?
* RAT - Remote Access Tools
* VPS - Virtual Private Server - ?
